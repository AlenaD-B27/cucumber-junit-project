   --- tag Scenario with @wip annotation (work in progress) and call this tag in runner (CukesRunner.java).
   --- in CukesRunner.java assign dryRun to true.

2. Run CukesRunner. ---> copy the snippets from console

3. in package step_defenitions create the StepDefinitions class and paste the snippets in it
